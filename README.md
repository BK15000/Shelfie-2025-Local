# Shelfie II
Our group is committed to developing a sophisticated solution in recognizing board games from their appearance. After experimenting with different approaches, we have decided on utilizing Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) and combining it with ChatGPT to correctly identify board games just from a picture of them sitting horizontally on a shelf. Our mission is to successfully improve the old team's project, which used a combination of YOLO for segmentation and SIFT for feature matching. We strive for the outcome of our project to be more universal with regards to what games it can recognize as well as higher accuracy rates compared to the old team's project.

# Branches

This project templates includes 2 branches to start with.  

| **Name**   | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Master         | Protected branch.  You cannot push directly to master.  This branch should be what you push to your test server (ceclnx for example) or other devices for your client to review. |
| . . .          | Thereafter, you should follow the code management strategy defined and agreed upon by the team.  I recommend a branch from master for each sprint or interval.  From the sprint-branch, I recommend branching by issue.  Throughout the sprint, rebase your issue branch regularly especially begore a commit.  If an issue is incomplete during the prescribed sprint, commit it to the next spring branch.  This approach gives the master branch an additional degree of protection. |
